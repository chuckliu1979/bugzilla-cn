## Bugzilla simplified Chinese (zh-CN) language pack files

### Download
Download is powered by github [releases](https://github.com/repeat/bugzilla-tw/releases) page. The version tag is same as which Bugzilla uses.

### Install

1. Take .tar.gz as an example. Untar it and there will be a folder named `bugzilla-cn-X.Y.Z/template/zh-CN/`. Simply copy this folder to where you install Bugzilla, under folder named `template`.
2. The `pax_global_header` file is generated automatically by github, but is not used.
